    "Pandemics have never taken center stage in the way they have this year with COVID-19. Vaccines are a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. Vaccines provide immunization for individuals, and enough immunization in a community can further reduce the spread of diseases through \"herd immunity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As of the writing of this post, vaccines for COVID-19 are still under development and not yet available. We will instead look at a recent historical pandemic, also of a deadly respiratory disease: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 flu virus, also called \"swine flu,\" first appeared in the spring of 2009 and quickly spread across the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccines for H1N1 were first publicly available in the United States in October 2009, when the United States government began a vaccination campaign. We will look at data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey collected to monitor vaccination rates during that campaign. This phone survey asked people whether they had received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with information they shared about their lives, opinions, and behaviors. A better understanding of how these characteristics have been associated with personal vaccination patterns may provide guidance for future public health efforts.\n",

There are 35 feature columns in total, each a response to a survey question. These questions cover several different topics, such as whether people observed safe behavioral practices, their opinions about the diseases and the vaccines, and their demographics. Check out the [problem description](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/211/) page for more information. \n",
    "- **Training Labels**: These are the labels corresponding to the observations in the training features. There are two target variables: `h1n1_vaccine` and `seasonal_vaccine`. Both are binary variables, with 1 indicating that a person received the respective flu vaccine and 0 indicating that a person did not receive the respective flu vaccine.\n",
    "- **Test Features**: These are the features for observations that you will use to generate predictions after training a model. We don't give you the labels for these samples—it's up to you to generate them.\n",

The two target variable columns are filled with 0.5 as an example. Your submission to the leaderboard must be in this exact format (with different prediction values) in order to be scored successfully!"

In particular, we interestingly see a strong correlation with `age_group` with the `seasonal_vaccine` but not with `h1n1_vaccine`. It appears that with seasonal flu, people act appropriately according to the fact that people [more impacted and have higher risk of flu-related complications with age](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm). It turns out though that H1N1 flu has an interesting relationship with age: [even though older people have higher risk of complications, they were less likely to get infected!](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/surveillanceqa.htm#7) While we know anything about causality from this analysis, it seems like the risk factors ended up being reflected in the vaccination rates.

We will use [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html), also known as Z-score scaling. This scales and shifts features so that they have zero mean and unit variance. \n",
    "- **NA Imputation**: Logistic regression does not handle NA values. We will use median imputation, which fills missing values with the median from the training data, implemented with [`SimpleImputer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html). \n",

Building pipelines is a best practice for building machine learning models. Among [other benefits](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html), it makes it easy to reuse on new data (such as our test data).\n",

Then, we use that with Scikit-Learn's [`ColumnTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html), which is a convenient way to grab columns out of a pandas data frame and then apply a specified transformer. \n",

[Regularization](https://towardsdatascience.com/regularization-in-machine-learning-76441ddcf99a) is useful because it reduces overfitting. Check out scikit-learn's documentation for [`LogisticRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) to read more.
