    "Pandemics have never taken center stage in the way they have this year with COVID-19. Vaccines are a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. Vaccines provide immunization for individuals, and enough immunization in a community can further reduce the spread of diseases through \"herd immunity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As of the writing of this post, vaccines for COVID-19 are still under development and not yet available. We will instead look at a recent historical pandemic, also of a deadly respiratory disease: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 flu virus, also called \"swine flu,\" first appeared in the spring of 2009 and quickly spread across the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccines for H1N1 were first publicly available in the United States in October 2009, when the United States government began a vaccination campaign. We will look at data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey collected to monitor vaccination rates during that campaign. This phone survey asked people whether they had received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with information they shared about their lives, opinions, and behaviors. A better understanding of how these characteristics have been associated with personal vaccination patterns may provide guidance for future public health efforts.\n",

We will use [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html), also known as Z-score scaling. This scales and shifts features so that they have zero mean and unit variance. \n",
